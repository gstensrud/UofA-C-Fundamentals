Welcome to my EXSM 3941 C# Fundamentals Assignment.

Today, July 10, 2022, the assignment was handed out.  I am looking forward to this one,
more than the other assignments that we have had.  I think I am finally starting to 
underestand writing this code.  It sure has been an uphill battle.

So far, figuring out how to start this Readme.md file has been a little bit of a pain in 
the ass, but with Jean-Marc's help, we got it figured out.  Now that this is here, the 
repository cloned, I am going to make the first commit.

Have some of the basic menu started and working.  Need to get the while loop working,
and the validation for the while loop.  Time for dinner.  going to save and commit.


Successful day.  Got the menu working, and all the validation for the user questions 
done and working.  I do really like the Xunit testing.  That was very convenient.

This morning was decent, the loop for entering a second recipe is giving me grief.
Hours of no luck

here we are monday night.  I fianll have all the math working anc correctly placed. 
What a pain in the ass that was.  In the end I turned to pen and paper to write a lot 
of this code.  It's definatly makeing a lot more sense as the days gon on.  About DAMN TIME!!


*** CURRENT KNOWN ISSUES!!! ***
	1) when trying menu option 2 there will be no file to recall after the recipe was wrote
		to the .txt file, as I am usure of where it will be on the users computer.

		-- I have thought about having this write to the desktop, then the user can easilt delete it
			or access it.

	2)
